This JavaScript function, fetchRecipes(), is designed to fetch recipes based on ingredients provided by the user from the Spoonacular API. 

Let's break down how it works:

1. Retrieve Ingredient Inputs:


```
let ing1 = $(".ing1").val();
let ing2 = $(".ing2").val();
let ing3 = $(".ing3").val();
```

These lines retrieve the values (ingredients) entered by the user into three input fields with classes "ing1", "ing2", and "ing3". These inputs are the ingredients the user wants to include in their recipe.

2. Construct API Request URL:



```let url = "https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/findByIngredients?apiKey=dafc1b303bf1432da17d25bd0e5ba8a2&ingredients=" + ing1 + "," + ing2 + "," + ing3 + "&number=1";```

Make sure you have your API key. We need it to build the custom URL for the Spoonacular API request. The URL includes the API key and the ingredients provided by the user as parameters. The "&number=1" parameter at the end of the URL specifies that only one recipe should be returned.

3. Create XMLHttpRequest Object:

```let request = new XMLHttpRequest();```

This line creates a new instance of the XMLHttpRequest object, which will be used to make the HTTP request to the Spoonacular API.

4. Open GET Request to Spoonacular API:

```request.open("GET", url, true);```

Here, the script opens a GET request to the constructed URL. The third parameter (true) specifies that the request should be asynchronous.

5. Define Request Completion Handler:

```request.onload = function() {
    let data = JSON.parse(this.response);
    if (request.status >= 200 && request.status < 400) {
        // Extract recipe information from the response
        // Update HTML elements with recipe details
    }
};```

Next we'll create a function that executes whent he request completes.

First, the function parses the JSON response received from the Spoonacular API. 

Next, the function checks if the request was successful (a status code between 200 and 399 indicates a successful request). If successful, it extracts a relevant recipe from the Spoonacular database and updates HTML elements on the page with the recipe details.

6. Send Request:


    ```request.send();```

    Finally, this line sends the HTTP request to the Spoonacular API.```

The function also includes an optional part where it fetches additional information about the recipe (such as instructions) using another Spoonacular API endpoint (/recipes/{id}/information). This information is fetched after the initial request and is handled similarly to the initial request.
